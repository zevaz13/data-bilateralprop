The motion capture data is divided in data cell arrays for each participant with dimensions (1x66). These correspond to the number of repetitions for each task
In each cell one can find a matrix with 2 x times samples. Row 1 corresponds to the positional data for the left finger. Row 2 corresponds to positional data for the right finger.

Some trials will have less samples (time) because of noise in the measurements
